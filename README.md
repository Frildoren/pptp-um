# pptp-um
**pptp-um** is a bash script used to manage the users of your pptp-client (chap-secrets)

# How to use
Download the script and give it the proper permissions to execute:

``` chmod +x pptp-um.sh ```


Then you can use the -i option to install the required components and copy the script to the /usr/bin directory (this will require superuser)

``` sudo ./pptp-um.sh -i ```
